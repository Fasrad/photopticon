# This is an example config file for photopticon. It uses these parameters. 
# typically you want to start tuning these parameters from top to bottom. 
# generally you will be able to use the same config file for any number of 
# composite images as long as your needs don't change. You will need to create 
# different config files for each negative-page or contact-printer format.
# If you use a camera to "scan" the contact prints, you will need to use a 
# different config file for images gathered in different sessions, unless you can 
# get the tripod aligned exactly the same every time. 

# boolean options enter 1 for yes/true and 0 for false/no

# Tips:
# Tune parameters roughly in order top to bottom. 

# Set top and bottom cropping to leave a strip half as wide as the vertical space
# between negative strips. This will keep images vertically centered in the slop window.

# If you are going to include positive slop to the left and right, leave enough room to the
# left of the leftmost image, and to the right of the rightmost image, to encompass
# the slop. If you globally crop right to the edge of the left and right images, and 
# then program in positive slop, the images toward the edges
# will not be centered in the "slop window"

# Try setting rows and columns both to "1" initially, to help when setting initial
# cropping of the full sheet.
