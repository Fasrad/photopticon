# This is an example config file for photopticon. It uses these parameters. 
# typically you want to start tuning these parameters from top to bottom. 
# generally you will be able to use the same config file for any number of 
# composite images as long as your needs don't change. You will need to create 
# different config files for each negative-page or contact-printer format.
# If you use a camera to "scan" the contact prints, you will need to use a 
# different config file for images gathered in different sessions, unless you can 
# get the tripod aligned exactly the same every time. 

# boolean options enter 1 for yes/true and 0 for false/no

# pre-crop operations
pre_rotation: 10  # Slow, lossy. Scan straighter to avoid having to rotate. Degrees clockwise. 
pre_scale: 50    # Applied to composite image before cropping. Percent. 
monochrome: 1     # Color photography is never going to catch on anyway. Boolean.
top_crop: 1       # in pixels
left_crop: 1      # in pixels
bottom_crop: 2    # in pixels
right_crop: 2     # in pixels
images_per_row: 5 # in pixels. Photopticon uses a regular grid. 
rows: 7           # in pixels. if your images have inconsistent spacing, sorry.
slop: 0           # in pixels. slop allows overlap between images. Use a lot to be safe. 

# post-crop operations done to individual images
normalize: 1    # Stretch histogram after cropping. Typically good. Boolean.
sharpen: 1      # unsharp mask. Boolean.
annotate: 1     # imprint file, image number onto the image. Boolean.
