# This is an example config file for photopticon. It uses these parameters. 
# typically you want to start tuning these parameters from top to bottom. 
# generally you will be able to use the same config file for any number of 
# composite images as long as your needs don't change. You will need to create 
# different config files for each negative-page or contact-printer format.
# If you use a camera to "scan" the contact prints, you will need to use a 
# different config file for images gathered in different sessions, unless you can 
# get the tripod aligned exactly the same every time. 

# boolean options enter 1 for yes/true and 0 for false/no
